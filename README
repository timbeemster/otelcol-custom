1. Run build the custom otel collector

`docker build --no-cache .`

2. find the image to run `docker images`

3. run the image with versions

All of the below scenarios worked on v108.0 of otelcollector/spanmetrics

## Scenario 1: Only digits:

`docker run -e VERSION=123 <image hash>`

*Expected result*:
Start correctly (or atleast not fail on the VERSION)

*Actual result*: 
```
